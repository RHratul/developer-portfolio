            <p>You might saw me from a distnace where I seem like a happy, dont care type,
                meme lover, marvel, anime and gaming things loving person. But I have
                a strange backstory that may shock you. But yeah, I'm trying to chill
                through life.Also trying to be happy with everything I have
                and avoiding every single thing that gives me negative vibes
                and lowers my spirit.People things I'm self-centered and
                thats kinda true.But the actual matter is, I dont like to
                show off my care or love for others. I pretend that I
                dont care. But end of the the, I do. One thing I can
                proudly say that I'm an Man of Morality and Commitment.</p>

                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
